This repository is for the first lab in CSCB07!

Contains a polynomial file and driver. 

Polynomial File: 

Field: An array of doubles representing the coefficients of the polynomial.
Example: The polynomial (6 - 2x + 5x^3) is represented as [6, -2, 0, 5].

Constructors:
No-argument constructor: Initializes the polynomial to zero ([0]).
Parameterized constructor: Takes an array of doubles to set the coefficients.

Methods:
add(Polynomial p): Returns the sum of the current polynomial and the polynomial p.
evaluate(double x): Evaluates the polynomial for a given value of (x).
Example: For the polynomial (6 - 2x + 5x^3), evaluate(-1) returns 3.
hasRoot(double x): Checks if the given value of (x) is a root of the polynomial (i.e., if the polynomial evaluates to zero for that value).

Driver File: 
Tests the constructors, add, evaluate, example and hasRoot functions in the Polynomial file.
